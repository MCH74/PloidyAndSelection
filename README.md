# PloidyAndSelection
Here you can find a collection of scripts that were used for the creation of two manuscripts investigating the effects of ploidy on selection:
"Deleterious mutation accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana pollen genes: a role for a recent relaxation of selection" &
"Purged haploids - sheltered diploids: ploidy influences selection efficacy in a haplodiploid bee."
